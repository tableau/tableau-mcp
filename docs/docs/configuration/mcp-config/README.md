# Configuring Tableau MCP

The Tableau MCP server makes use of environment variables to configure its behavior.

Environment variables can be provided in many different ways, including:

- System and user level environment variables.
- Environment variables specified in a `.env` file.
- AI tools via their MCP configuration.
- [A variety of ways](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/)
  when running in Docker.
